This Python script provides a file comparison and copying tool between two selected folders. It utilizes the Windows Shell API for folder selection and calculates file hashes to identify unique files. The script prompts the user to select two folders, compares the files in them using SHA-256 hashes, and copies the files from the second folder that are not present in the first folder.

Dependencies:
- Python
- `hashlib`, `os`, `ctypes`, `shutil`, `uuid`: Standard Python libraries
- `tqdm`: A library for displaying progress bars in the console

Description:
1. **BROWSEINFO Structure**: Defines the structure for folder selection using the Windows Shell API.

2. **Functions**:
   - `calculate_hash(file_path)`: Calculates the SHA-256 hash of a file.
   - `get_files_in_folder(folder_path)`: Retrieves a list of files in a specified folder.
   - `compare_and_copy_files(src_folder, dest_folder)`: Compares file hashes between two folders and copies unique files to the source folder.
   - `path_to_pidl(path)`: Converts a file path to a pointer to an ITEMIDLIST structure.
   - `select_folder(lpszTitle)`: Uses the Windows Shell API to prompt the user to select a folder.
   - `ask_repeat()`: Asks the user if they want to repeat the process.

3. **Main Execution**:
   - The script enters a loop where the user is prompted to select two folders for comparison.
   - It compares the files in the selected folders and copies unique files from the second folder to the first.
   - The user is given the option to repeat the process.

The script is designed for Windows environments due to its reliance on the Windows Shell API for folder selection. It can be used for tasks such as synchronizing files between two folders while preserving unique files in the destination folder.

Note: The script depends on the `tqdm` library for displaying progress bars. Ensure it is installed (`pip install tqdm`) before running the script.
